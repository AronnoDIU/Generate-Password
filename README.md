# Generate-Password
This project is a Java Console Application to generate random passwords and perform password strength checks.

A strong password generator is a tool that automatically generates random and complex passwords based on guidelines that you set to create strong and unpredictable passwords for each of your accounts.

The best password generator uses cryptographic entropy to generate random passwords for use online. However, we've built the Avast password generator to eliminate that frustration while serving as a free password generator for the public. The webpage relies solely on your computer as the password creator. The randomized auto password generator leaves you with safe, secure passwords to use online and offline.
